# Python dependencies for Humanoid AI Robot Mini

# For general utilities, logging
# No specific external libraries strictly required for this basic structure,
# but common ones for robotics/AI projects would include:

# For hardware communication (e.g., serial port)
# pyserial

# For computer vision (if implementing actual object detection)
# opencv-python
# numpy

# For speech recognition (if using local models or specific APIs)
# SpeechRecognition
# PyAudio # for microphone access

# For text-to-speech
gTTS # Required for text-to-speech generation

# For machine learning models (if adding more complex AI)
# tensorflow
# pytorch
# scikit-learn

# For web API (if UI_MODE is 'API')
Flask
# uvicorn
# fastapi
